Frequencies of N-words are stored here

- **freqNword** subdirectory contains the aggregated frequency data over 40 years (1972 to 2012)
- **ignored_items** subdirectory contains the frequencies of ignored items (reasons : Part Of Speech not available for all the words in the NGram, or NGrams that are made of punctuation signs and not letters)
- **raw-data** subdirectory contains the computation steps that lead to the final frequency measure (aw_ggregation of book count throughout the years for example). Choosing raw_data output is memory consumming. It stores the full unzipped Google file.
